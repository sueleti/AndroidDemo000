/** setContent is a function that sets the content view of the activity to a composable function.
 * In this case, it sets the content to a Text composable that displays "Hello world!".
 * The MainActivity class extends ComponentActivity, which is a base class for activities that use Jetpack Compose.
 * The onCreate method is overridden to set the content when the activity is created.
 * The Text composable is part of the Material3 library, which provides Material Design components for Compose.
 * The Text composable is used to display text on the screen, and it takes a string as a parameter.
 * In this case, the string is "Hello world!", which will be displayed when the app is run.
 * This is a simple example of how to use Jetpack Compose to create a basic Android app with a single text view.
